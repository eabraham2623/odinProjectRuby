# How Ruby Course will work
* Learning Ruby first, then Ruby on Rails


## Intro to Ruby
* Created in mid 90s
* Designed for programmer productivity
* Abstractions, being removed from what's happening under the hood
* Domain Specific Languages
    * Examples
        * Rails
        * Rspec
* Ruby Runtime needed

## Ruby Style
```ruby
# Naming a file
this_is_a_snake_cased_file.rb

# Assigning a variable
forty_two = 42

# Defining a method
def this_is_a_great_method
  # do stuff
end
```
* Class Methods and Instance Methods
* `::` used to define a namespace, can also be for class methods
* `#` are instance methods
* Every class sub classes from some `parent`
* `irb`, testing Ruby code snippets in terminal
* Ruby code gets executed by an interpreter
* RubyGems, Ruby libraries, and the publishing system behind it
* `irb` stands for Interactive Ruby Console
    * `irb -r ./your_file.rb`
