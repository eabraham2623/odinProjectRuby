# Bubble Sort
## General Algorithm
* Given an array, for each element, compare the element to the right of the current and swap them if the left element is greater than the right element. 
* Repeat whole process again until no swaps have been made
* Optimizing algorith, can ignore the lasted sorted element, since we know it is already the biggest
