# Problem Solving

## 3 Steps in Problem Solving

### Understand the Problem
* Gain clarity and understand problem
* Write problem out, reword it in plain english

### Plan/PseudoCode
#### Questions to consider
* Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
* What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
* What’s the desired output?
* Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

#### PsuedoCode
* Writing out logic for problem in natural language


### Divide and Conquer
* Identiify subproblems of big problem you're facing
* Pick smallest or simplest and start from there
* Break big problem down and solve each of the smaller probelms until you've solved the big problem

## Solving Fizz Buzz
### Understand the Problem
```
Write a program that takes a user’s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
```

### Plan/Pseudo Code
* Program only has an console log browser. 
* Inputs = one integer number
* User enters data
* Desired outputs:
    * loop of numbers until number user entered where:
        * Number if not multiple of 3 or 5
        * Fizz if multiple of 3
        * Buzz if multiple of 5
        * FizzBuzz if both multiple of 3 and 5

## How to think like a Programmer - Lessons in Problem Solving
* Trying solutions until one works isn't the best way to solve problems
* Best way involves:
    * having a framework
    * practicing the framework

### Have a framework
1. Understand
    * Most hard problems are hard because you don't understand them
    * When you can explain the problem in plain English, is when you understand it
    * Write down the problem to understand it
2. Plan
    * Given input X, what the the steps neccessary to return output Y?
3. Divide
    * Break it down into sub-problems
    * Solve each sub problem one by one
    * Connecting your sub solutions will give you the solution to the original problem
4. Stuck?
    * Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
    * Reassess: Look at problem from another perspective
    * Research: Find solutions to SUB PROBLEMS, rather than the big problem
