# Problem Solving

## 3 Steps in Problem Solving

### Understand the Problem
* Gain clarity and understand problem
* Write problem out, reword it in plain english

### Plan/PseudoCode
#### Questions to consider
* Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
* What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
* What’s the desired output?
* Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

#### PsuedoCode
* Writing out logic for problem in natural language


### Divide and Conquer
* Identiify subproblems of big problem you're facing
* Pick smallest or simplest and start from there
* Break big problem down and solve each of the smaller probelms until you've solved the big problem

## Solving Fizz Buzz
### Understand the Problem
```
Write a program that takes a user’s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
```

### Plan/Pseudo Code
* Program only has an console log browser. 
* Inputs = one integer number
* User enters data
* Desired outputs:
    * loop of numbers until number user entered where:
        * Number if not multiple of 3 or 5
        * Fizz if multiple of 3
        * Buzz if multiple of 5
        * FizzBuzz if both multiple of 3 and 5

## How to think like a Programmer - Lessons in Problem Solving
* Trying solutions until one works isn't the best way to solve problems
* Best way involves:
    * having a framework
    * practicing the framework

### Have a framework
1. Understand
    * Most hard problems are hard because you don't understand them
    * When you can explain the problem in plain English, is when you understand it
    * Write down the problem to understand it
2. Plan
    * Given input X, what the the steps neccessary to return output Y?
3. Divide
    * Break it down into sub-problems
    * Solve each sub problem one by one
    * Connecting your sub solutions will give you the solution to the original problem
4. Stuck?
    * Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
    * Reassess: Look at problem from another perspective
    * Research: Find solutions to SUB PROBLEMS, rather than the big problem

## How to think Like A Programmer - Video Notes
* How to be as stupid as a computer :)
* Good programmers aren't alwasy good teachers
* Programming isn't about languages
* Not a lot of memorizing
* Most programming isn't about math
* Programming languages simpler than human ones
* Explaining things to idiot computer
* Write out concepts first, then convert to code later
* Code explains the comments to the computer

### Eight Concepts of Coding
1. Make a new Variable
    * Name - What do we call thing?
    * Type - What type of data does it contain
    * InitVal - InitVal what is it's starting alue
    * Algorithm:
        * Create variable name of type type that starts with value initVal
2. Output
    * message: text to write to user
    * Output code
3. Input
    * variable: where answer from user will be stored
    * message: question being asked of the user
4. Failure is WONDERFUL!
    * Normal part of programming
    * Begin debugging
5. How to debug
    * best way to debug is to not have bugs
    * What am I not understanding?
    * Tools I can use?
6. Loop
    * for loop
        * Sentry
            * variable that will control loop
        * start
        * end
            * what will cause it to end
        * change
            * what changes senty

### Hello User is a good program to get a sense of a programming language

## What is Pseudo-Code
* Writing down logic of solution of problem using plain english
* Whiteboarding the problem
    * Broad overview of what needs to happen
    * filling in each part that requires more detail

# Knowledge Check
* 3 stages to problem solving:
    1. Plan
    2. PseudoCode
    3. Divide and Conquer
* It is important to understand the problem first otherwise your solution could be totally wrong and waste time
* You can rewrite the problem in your own words so you understand it better
* Understanding the inputs and outputs will help in the planning stage of the problem solving process
* An algorithm is a set of instructions to perform a task or solution
* Pseudocode is a set of instrucions written in plain english, not code for an attempted solution
* Advantages of breaking problem down and solving include solving simpler problems first, which in turn helps solve the bigger problems
