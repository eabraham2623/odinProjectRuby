# Working with Text HTML

## Paragraphs
* To separate paragraphs, need to use the `<p>` tag per paragraph

## Headings
* Displayed in larger and bolder text
* 6 different levels of headings
    * `<h1>` is largest, `<h6>` is smallest
* `<h1>` should be used for heading of overall page

## Strong element
* `<strong>` element makes text bold
* used in combination with other elements like `<p>` or `<h_n>`

## Em element
* `<em>` makes text italic
    * stands for emphasis
* used in combination with other elements like `<p>` or `<h_n>`

## Nesting and indentation
* HTML parent elements can have many children
* Same level are considered to be siblings

## HTML Comments
* `<!-- I am html comment -->` 
    * is an example
