# Working with Text HTML

## Paragraphs
* To separate paragraphs, need to use the `<p>` tag per paragraph

## Headings
* Displayed in larger and bolder text
* 6 different levels of headings
    * `<h1>` is largest, `<h6>` is smallest
* `<h1>` should be used for heading of overall page

## Strong element
* `<strong>` element makes text bold
* used in combination with other elements like `<p>` or `<h_n>`

## Em element
* `<em>` makes text italic
    * stands for emphasis
* used in combination with other elements like `<p>` or `<h_n>`

## Nesting and indentation
* HTML parent elements can have many children
* Same level are considered to be siblings

## HTML Comments
* `<!-- I am html comment -->` 
    * is an example

# Knowledge Check
* To create a paragraph use `<p>`
* To create heading use `<h1>`
* Different levels of headings rang from 1 to 6, Difference is that 1 is largest text, while 6 is smallest
* The element to make text bold and important is `<strong>`
* The element to make text italiczied is `<em>`
* The relationship that an element has with an nested element is that the nested element are it's children
* Same level elements are considered to be **siblings**
* To create HTML comments use:
    * `<!-- text here -->`
