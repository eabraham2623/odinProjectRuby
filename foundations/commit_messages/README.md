# How to Write Git commit message
* Commit message can properly tell you why
* Whether dev is a good collabarotor
* Teams should agree on following three conventions
    * Style 
    * Content
    * Metadata

## 7 Rules
1. Separate subject from with a blank line
2. Limit subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end subject line with period
5. Use the imperative mood in subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain **what and why** vs how

`git commit -m "Subject" -m "body"`

# Knowledge Check
* Two benefits of having well written commit messages and good commit history
    1. For collaborative purposes
    2. If I'm away from project, I can trace back what I have done with the history
* 50 characters should be the subject line of commit message
